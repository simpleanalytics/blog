The monthly update of Simple Analytics will look a bit different than normal. This time I took screenshots of all data within the dashboard of Stripe and will comment on every single aspect of it. If you like graphs and numbers, this is your month!

We also hit a new milestone: \$6000 MRR. But you have lots of milestones if you switch between the number of paying customers, monthly recurring revenue and annual recurring revenue. Too me the MRR is the most important metric of these three because I can see every moment if I'm still adding value compared to last month.

We use Stripe as our payment provider. It's a bit complex for our use case, but almost everything we want is possible in the end. Simple Analytics is located in The Netherlands and this comes with its tax requirements. If we would have a payment provider that also worked well with doing taxes, then that would be a huge benefit.

I copied the main dashboard of Stripe and sliced all visible metric blocks into the images you see below. I didn't leave out any metric because I believe it's good to cover all aspects. Feel free to skip the ones your don't find interesting.

> This data showing 12 months from June 1, 2019 to May 31, 2020. The comparison with the previous 12 months is not completely fair because we don't exist for 2 years yet.

The first paragraph explains the metric, then comes the metric graph and numbers, and below that I try to shed some light on the numbers regarding Simple Analytics.

## Gross volume

Gross volume is the total sales value. This number does include costs like fees, refunds, and disputes.

<p class="caption t-a-c" markdown="1">Gross volume</p>

I don't look at this number much because it doesn't really say that much about the current state of our startup. It is a great number to look back on though. When building your startup it's easy to only focus on the MRR but it can be a nice push when looking at the gross volume. You might think: "My customers paid me this amount of money for my service." That's a nice feeling.

## New volume from sales

Estimated revenue from payments after fees, refunds, disputes, and Connect transfers have been deducted.

<p class="caption t-a-c" markdown="1">New volume from sales</p>

This is very much the same as the gross volume. To me it's equally important and also don't use this number much. It's logical that it's a bit lower than the gross volume as fees, refunds, and disputes are deducted.

## New customers

Number of new customers created including ones that are no longer active. Inactive customers are customers who have been deleted.

<img class="border" src="/images/2020-05/03-new-customers@2x.png" alt="New customers of Simple Analytics from June 2019 to May 2020" loading="lazy" style="margin-top: 0; width: 515px;" />
<p class="caption t-a-c" markdown="1">New customers</p>

One of the things that stands out here is the spike you see in the grey line. You will see this spike in more graphs. It's because we were a target of credit card testing. [Card testing](https://www.verifi.com/in-the-news/prepared-card-testing-fraud/) happens when fraudsters test stolen credit card details by making small online purchases. The fraudsters need to check the validity of the credit card details, and once they confirm the credit card is valid they proceed with making larger fraudulent purchases. It would be great is there was a way to delete these transactions completely from Stripe, but as far as I know this is not possible.

Back to the real number: new customers. In the last 12 months we had 638 new customers. That's ~53 new customers per month and ~1,7 per day.

## Successful payments

<p class="caption t-a-c" markdown="1">Successful payments</p>

## Spend per customer

Estimated revenue for all payments created with a customer, divided by the total number of customers with payments.

<p class="caption t-a-c" markdown="1">Spend per customer</p>

## Dispute activity

Estimated number of disputes divided by the number of successful payments in the same time series. Inquiries and Retrievals are not included in your dispute rate.

## High risk payments

Stripe Radar uses machine learning to determine if a payment is likely to be fraudulent.

<p class="caption t-a-c" markdown="1">High risk payments</p>

## New subscribers

This is the total number of new non-trial, paid subscribers (not including free plans).

<img class="border" src="/images/2020-05/09-new-subscribers@2x.png" alt="New subscribers of Simple Analytics from June 2019 to May 2020" loading="lazy" style="margin-top: 0; width: 515px;" />

## Monthly Recurring Revenue

Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) is your normalized monthly revenue from all active and past-due subscriptions. It’s the best single measure of the health and trajectory of a recurring revenue business.

<p class="caption t-a-c" markdown="1">Monthly Recurring Revenue</p>

Funny enough Stripe deducts their own fee from this number. Not sure why they do this, but it's not accurate at least. If you deduct their fee from our own calculated MRR number it's still a bit off. This might be due to conversion rates between the dollar and the euro. Our payouts are in euro.

## New trials

This is the total number of new subscriptions that started with a free trial period.

<img class="border" src="/images/2020-05/11-new-trials@2x.png" alt="New trials of Simple Analytics from June 2019 to May 2020" loading="lazy" style="margin-top: 0; width: 515px;" />
<p class="caption t-a-c" markdown="1">New trials</p>

## Trial conversion rate

This measures your success at converting trials to active subscriptions during a rolling 30-day period. Out of all trials that ended in the last 30 days, your trial conversion rate is the percentage that converted to an active subscription.

<p class="caption t-a-c" markdown="1">Trial conversion rate</p>

## Lifetime value

This is an estimate of the total revenue you can expect to collect from your average customer before they churn.

<img class="border" src="/images/2020-05/13-lifetime-value@2x.png" alt="Lifetime value of Simple Analytics from June 2019 to May 2020" loading="lazy" style="margin-top: 0; width: 515px;" />
<p class="caption t-a-c" markdown="1">Lifetime value</p>

## Revenue per subscriber

This is your average MRR per subscriber. It’s calculated by dividing your MRR by the total number of customers with an active subscription.

<p class="caption t-a-c" markdown="1">Revenue per subscriber</p>

## Subscriber churn rate

This measures the portion of your subscribers who left during a rolling 30-day period. Out of all active customers at the start of the period and any new customers in the period, your churn rate is the percentage that cancel during the period.

<p class="caption t-a-c" markdown="1">Subscriber churn rate</p>

## Churned revenue

This is the total MRR lost during the period due to downgrades or cancelations (both voluntary or involuntary due to lack of payment).

<p class="caption t-a-c" markdown="1">Churned revenue</p>

## Subscriber retention by cohort

This table displays subscriber retention for each month following the month that the subscription started, called the cohort. If a customer unsubscribes and then resubscribes, they will be a part of two cohorts.

You made it through all these numbers! Your math teacher would have been proud. If you have some experience with SaaS businesses and you can spot some easy fixes, please let me know. Happy to implement your feedback to get these numbers higher.
