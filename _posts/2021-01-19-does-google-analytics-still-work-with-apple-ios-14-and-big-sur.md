## Can you continue using Google Analytics?

**It depends.**

Mainly depending on what you want to do with it. (check the bottom of the article for tips on when or when not to use Google Analytics)

When Apple launched the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS Big Sur, they threw in a lot of new privacy features to help protect users from being tracked across the internet.

Built into Safari across all three platforms, they launched a new ‘Privacy Report’ which provides a summary of the number of trackers blocked. You guessed it, the most frequently blocked tracker is currently Google Analytics. **This makes it easy to assume that Apple is blocking Google Analytics from tracking your visitors and messing with your statistics.** However, the truth is a bit more complicated than this. Let me explain…

## Blocking Third-Party Tracking Cookies

As more information has surfaced, it appears that **Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) in Safari 14 is not completely blocking Google Analytics**. Instead, it's blocking third-party tracking cookies and cross-site scripting requests, which limits portions of Google Analytics. The Privacy Report feature just reflects that. It seems that first-party Google Analytics cookies aren't blocked, so it still functions as an analytics platform. However, you can’t use the platform any longer to retarget people across different sites. Oh, and in case you’re wondering: **“What’s the difference between these cookies?**” It’s this:

- **First-party cookies** are stored by the domain (website) you are visiting directly. They allow website owners to collect analytics data, remember language settings, and perform other useful actions that provide a better user experience.
- **Third-party cookies** are created by domains other than the one you are visiting directly, hence the name third-party. They are used for cross-site tracking, retargeting and ad-serving.
