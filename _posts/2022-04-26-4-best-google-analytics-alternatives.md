4 Best Google Analytics Alternatives

Excerpt: There are more and more privacy-friendly Google Analtyics alternatives, but which one is the best?

The call for privacy-friendly Google Analtyics alternatives has never been this high. More and more businesses are turning their back on Google Analytics after the French, and [Austrian 'Data Watchdogs' considered it violating privacy regulations.](https://noyb.eu/en/austrian-dsb-eu-us-data-transfers-google-analytics-illegal)

But what is the best alternative to Google Analytics? With more and more options entering the market, it might be hard to distinguish these alternatives from one another. That's why we decided to do some research.

We've already written an [in-depth comparison focusing on the privacy part](https://blog.simpleanalytics.com/4-privacy-friendly-google-analytics-alternatives). However, privacy is only one part of the equation (albeit the most important one). This article focuses on the other parts: Data insights, ease of use, data interoperability, and costs.

Consider this part 2.

In this article we'll be benchmarking the privacy-friendly Google Analytics alternatives on the following properties:

-   Data Insights: What insights do they provide? 
-   Ease of use: How easy is it to get started?
-   Data Interoperability: How easily does it work with other tools?
-   Costs: How expensive is it to use?

Let's dive in!

## Google Analytics Alternatives

Google Analytics is the default web analytics tool for the majority of the internet. 80% of the websites using an analytics tool are using Google Analytics. It's a free and very powerful tool that tracks every move of every website visitor.

In terms of data insights, Google Analytics is the number one in the web analytics market. However, with respect to privacy it faces a lot of issues. Therefore, the market for Google Analytics alternatives is growing.

Like our last comparision article, we'll compare the same four alternatives we believe are worth looking into:\
- [Simple Analytics](https://simpleanalytics.com/)
- [Plausible](https://plausible.io/)
- [Matomo](https://matomo.org/)
- [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/)

## 1. Simple Analytics

Simple Analytics is the furthest away from Google Analytics in many ways. This is because Simple Analytics [never collects any personal data or uses cookies.](https://blog.simpleanalytics.com/website-analytics-without-cookies) As mentioned earlier, this does have an impact on the amount of data insights.
  
### Data Insights
Collecting sessions over multiple days is, for example, not possible with Simple Analytics. It is still possible to differentiatie between page views and unique visitors based on the referrer domain (but this is less accurate than session tracking). However, the page views reported by Simple Analytics are more accurate than in Google Analytics, because you don't need cookie consent using Simple Analytics, and unlike Google Analytics, Simple Analytics can bypass adblockers.

It is also possible to use UTM codes to see which specific sources generate traffic to your website and you can track events. We've set up an automated events script that collects downloads, outbound links, and clicks on email links and you can add your custom events.\

### User Experience
Whereas Google Analytics welcomes you with 75 reports and multiple dashboards, Simple Analytics has a [one-page dashboard](https://simpleanalytics.com/simpleanalytics.com) that shows you the most important metrics in a straightforward overview.

Everything is clickable in the overview, so segmenting is easy. Simple Analytics also visualizes source links. For example, clicking on 'Twitter' in the referrer section gives you an overview of Twitter traffic and shows the exact tweets that caused the traffic spike.

In addition, Simple Analytics is a lightweight analytics tool (3kb). Switching from Google Analytics (45kb) will increase your page load speed, increasing your website visitors' user experience

### Data interoperability
It's possible to import your Google Analytics data directly into Simple Analytics, so you won't lose any historical data by switching to Simple Analytics.
It's also easy to export your data from Simple Analytics by using the API. In addition, there are multiple integrations with dashboarding tools like powerbi and Google Data Studio

### Costs
Simple Analytics has two plans. The Starter plan and the Business plan.\
- Starter Plan: 19$ (or 9$ on a yearly deal) for up to 100,000 page views per month.\
- Business plan 59$ (or 49$ on a yearly plan) for up to 1 million page views per month.\
- After 1 million pageviews, Simple Analytics offers custom deals.
  
## 2. Plausible

</p>

Plausible is closer to Simple Analytics than to Google Analytics and also built by a small team focused on privacy and ease of use.

### Data Insights
Plausible does not make use of cookies and only collects personal data anonymized for 24 hours. This approach aligns with their privacy vision and provides you more data insights. By collecting IP addresses for 24 hours, Plausible can track sessions on the same day, making  their unique visitor count a bit more accurate. Conversions on the same day can be attributed as well. It's, therefore, easier to set goals and track conversions. In addition, they can show visitors' locations on the city level, whereas Simple Analytics does this on the country level.

In comparison to Simple Analytics, they provide more data but are also less privacy-friendly.

### User Experience
Plausible looks similar to Simple Analytics in that they use a one-page dashboard to show key metrics. It also works the same in that everything is clickable and segmenting is easy. The UI looks very good and its built in a very intuitive way.

Plausible is also a lightweight web analytics tool (1kb). The impact on your page load speed is therefore very low. Switching from Google Analytics to Plausible will have a positive impact on your page load speed.

### Data Interoperability
For a few weeks, it's now possible to import data from Google Analytics directly into Plausible. You won't have to deal with a loss of historical data moving to Plausible. It also has an API to export your data. From the docs on their website, we don't see any integrations with dashboarding tools like Powerbi or Google Data Studio.

### Costs
Plausible has a free plan as it's open source. You can use Plausible and host the data on-premise. So if you are very technical you can host your own analytics. This means you only need to pay for your own hosting. They also offer paid options, where the data is hosted for you:\
- 9$ Per month for up to 10,000 pageviews.\
- 19$ Per month for up to 100,000 pageviews 
- 69$ Per month for up to 1 million pageviews

## 3. Matomo

Matomo is the oldest alternative to Google Analytics. In the early days, they teamed up with Piwik Pro, but went on their own again in 2018. There focus is more on data insights and 'owning' your data.

### Data insights
Where Plausible and Simple Analytics are similar in the sense that they are "simple", Matomo is more complex. In their default mode, Matomo uses cookies and also collects IP-addresses (in an anonymized way). Hence you can get more insights than in Simple Analytics or Plausible because visitors are tracked on an individual level.

### User Experience
From the screenshot of their dashboard above, you can see that is has in lot in common with Google Analytics. Matomo welcomes you with multiple dashboards and reports. It is more complex than the easily segmentable one-page dashboard from Simple Analytics and Plausible. In addition, the page load speed is also impacted when installing Matomo on your website. Their script is 7 times larger than Simple Analytics' script (22kb).

Overall, Matomo is an extensive tool but it comes with a lot of directions and tutorials to understand how it works. For example, its possible to use Matomo in a cookieless version but it takes you through a bunch of tutorials and custom steps to get started.

### Data Interoperability
You can import your historical data from Google Analytics in Matomo. However, this is a long and complex tutorial, so if you are brave you are fine. It is offers an integration with Google Data studio, however not with other dashboarding tools.

### Costs
Matomo is open source and can be used for free on premise. So if you are technical, you can host your own analytics. You only need to pay for your own hosting. They also offer a paid version in which the analytics will be hosted on Matomo's servers.

## 4. Fathom

<p class="Fathom dashboard" markdown="1">

</p>

Fathom has the philosophy of displaying a straightforward dashboard with all the key metrics and focuses on privacy. It is very similar to Plausible and in a lesser sense to Simple Analytics.

### Data insights
Fathom does not install cookies and only collects IP addresses for 24 hours in an anoynimized way. They take exactly the same approach as Plausible. They are privacy focused but because of the fact that they do collect IP addresses, Fathom is able to provide more insights (but is also less privacy-friendly).

### User Experience
Also in terms of user experience its similar to Plausible and Simple Analytics. However, the dashboard seems a bit less intuitive than the other two. It feel less easy to navigate and the colours make it less clear compared to Simple Analytics or Plausible.

The impact on page load speed however, is also very small. Switching from Google Analytics to Fathom would therefore positively affect your page load speed.

### Data Interoperability
From their documentation we could not find if it was possible to import Google Analytics data into Fathom. However, in their latest blog post they suggest they are building something that would make this possible.

Through their API it is already possible to export your data directly into your favorite dashboarding tools.

### Costs
Fathom is not open source. They only offer a paid solutions:
- 14$ for up to 100,000 pageviews
- 54$ for up to 1 million pageviews

## Conclusion

The conclusion of this piece: There is no single 'best' alternative.

It ultimately depends on your needs in terms of data and your stance toward privacy. There is a privacy trade-off: The more data you want to collect on the individual level, the more privacy-invasive tools you will need to use.

</p>

You need to decide how important the privacy of your visitors is to you and what data you really need to make decisions.\
Data-hungry organizations will be more likely to use either Matomo or Google Analytics, as those two provide the most data. Whereas privacy-conscious organizations that want to see what's happening on their website but don't need to track everyone individually will opt for Simple Analytics, Plausible, or Fathom.

Privacy-friendly solutions are here to stay. Choose the one that fits your needs while preserving the privacy of your users. They will be thankful.
