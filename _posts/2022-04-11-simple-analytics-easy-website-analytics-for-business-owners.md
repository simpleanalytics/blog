While [privacy-friendliness is one of our most important pillars](https://blog.simpleanalytics.com/website-analytics-without-cookies), we shouldn't forget that we're also here for business owners that want to get the insights they need without the hassle.

It has always been our goal to provide easy website analytics. A straightforward [one-page dashboard](https://simpleanalytics.com/simpleanalytics.com) that gives you all the insights you need and comes with a simple integration.

Let's dive in!

# 1\. Why do you need website analytics?

We believe website analytics should be used as a barometer for your website performance.\
The purpose is to help you understand what you are doing right and what you need to improve. Understand how people interact with your site and gather the information you need to make informed business decisions.

We don't believe in tracking every user and using tens or even hundreds of dashboards to find minuscule improvements while losing the bigger picture.

# 2\. What insights should a website analytics tool provide? 

To use website analytics as a navigation tool, you need to think about which metrics and KPIs are important to you. What insights would you like to see, and what data do you need? 

The answer to this question will be very different for someone with an e-commerce website than for a web analyst in the healthcare industry. Therefore, it amazes me that still (almost) every organization uses the same analytics tool: [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/).

Almost every organization just plugs in Google Analytics without really thinking about what data they really need and what criteria are important to them (and what they are signing up for when partnering with Google).

For some companies, Google Analytics fits like a glove. E-commerce websites that rely heavily on ads and user tracking will benefit from the power of Google Analytics. However, organizations conscious of their users' privacy should not use Google Analytics. The same goes for business owners who want the insights they need in a straightforward overview.

You can conclude that there is just no one-size-fits-all, but still, everyone uses Google Analytics. 

# 3\. Google Analytics is a complex tool

Google Analytics is the most powerful website analytics tool but also the most complex. It's overwhelming for beginners, and it requires training to grasp all the functionalities fully. If you have never used it before, you will find it hard to understand how it works.

When you login into your Google Analytics dashboard, you are welcomed by an overload of options and reports that you will most likely never even touch. There is simply no need for multiple layers of menus and custom reports to give you the insights you need.

For most organizations, Google Analytics might not be the right tool. Especially for those that want a clean and straightforward overview of their website performance. We believe you can get the insights you need without going through the horror of Google Analytics. That's why we built Simple Analytics as [an alternative to Google Analytics](https://blog.simpleanalytics.com/why-simple-analytics-is-a-great-alternative-to-google-analytics).

# 4\. Simple Analytics is an easy analytics tool 

Simple Analytics is built on two foundational beliefs. First of all, we didn't want to track users and [collect personal data](https://docs.simpleanalytics.com/what-we-collect). All our parameters are set up with that in mind, so you directly comply with [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/), [PECR](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/what-are-pecr/) & [CCPA](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa) regulations. Secondly, we wanted to provide an easy analytics tool that gives you the data you need in a clean one-page dashboard with [simple integration](https://docs.simpleanalytics.com/script).

The dashboard gives you insights into your website performance. You can see the page views and visitors and easily adjust your preferred timespan. In one overview, you can directly see how your website is performing.

Underneath the main visual, you can find your relevant parameters. On the left, you can see your referral sources. These are the sources for your website traffic and are ranked accordingly. It is also possible to [overwrite these referral domains with URL parameters](https://docs.simpleanalytics.com/how-to-use-url-parameters). Using Simple Analytics, you can still you UTM-codes to evaluate specific sources.

The pages section covers the pages on which visitors land on your website. You can look for certain keywords to find information about specific pages using the magnifying glass. Everything is clickable, and by clicking on a particular page, the other parameters are segmented accordingly to that particular page. Here is what that looks like:

Mini websites as referral links

We also show referral links as mini-websites in our quest to make the cleanest dashboard possible. For example, if you want to view the traffic coming from Twitter, we show you the exact tweets responsible for the traffic. In Google Analytics and other web analytics tools, they will be displayed as a t.co link without any additional information.

Lightweight vs. Heavyweight

At Simple Analytics, we focus on the essentials. We believe there is no need for multiple data layers and custom reports for you to make impactful decisions. As a result, the analytics script we run on your website is 15 times smaller than the Google Analytics script (3kb vs. 45kb).

Using our script has a positive effect on your page load speed. Or, if you put it differently, [Google penalizes you for using Google Analytics](https://blog.simpleanalytics.com/google-penalizes-you-for-using-google-analytics). Adding scripts to your website impacts the performance of your website. The heavier the script, the longer the loading time of your website. Adding Google's script to your website negatively impacts your overall user experience due to increased load time and affects your ability to rank in search engines (like Google).

Export your data using our API

We don't share your data with third parties or transfer it overseas. The data is stored in the EU and stays there. The data is yours, and we believe you should use the data most effectively. With the [Simple Analytics API](https://docs.simpleanalytics.com/api), you can export your data via streaming. The data is directly transferred to your server or computer from our database. You can also export the data by selecting the fields you want and exporting the data into your dashboarding tools.

1.  Which analytics tool should you choose?
    ---------------------------------------

Google Analytics is the standard but might not be the optimal tool for everyone. There is no one-size-fits-all. If you need specific custom reports or rely heavily on tracking and don't care about privacy, Simple Analytics might not be the right tool for you.

Simple Analytics is the right tool for you if you:

...use analytics as a navigational tool and want to see the bigger picture

...want a simple dashboard with all the essentials metrics\
...care about the privacy of your website visitors

...don't want to sell your data

...want to support the independent web

Who are we?\
Simple Analytics is a two-person team that values the privacy of internet users and believes you can get all the relevant insights without using personal data. We are bootstrapped (meaning we are not funded) and are transparent about everything we do. We have an [open roadmap](https://simpleanalytics.com/roadmap) that you also can contribute to.

This is how we try to make the internet a little bit safer for everyone---interested in coming along on our journey? [Give us a try!  ](https://simpleanalytics.com/welcome)
